# Project 01 — CAPM & Beta Estimation

## Overview
This project empirically applies the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** to estimate the
systematic risk (Beta) of a stock relative to the market and to compute its expected return.
The objective is to quantify how much risk an investor takes by holding a specific asset
and how that risk should be priced.

## CAPM Beta Regression (Apple vs Market)

---

## Project Setup
- **Asset:** Apple Inc. (AAPL)
- **Market Benchmark:** S&P 500 Index
- **Time Period:** 2019–2024
- **Data Frequency:** Daily returns
- **Method:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression

---

## Methodology
1. Download historical adjusted prices for the stock and the market.
2. Compute daily percentage returns.
3. Estimate the CAPM regression:

\[
R_{stock} = \alpha + \beta R_{market} + \varepsilon
\]

4. Extract Beta, Alpha, and R-squared.
5. Compute the expected return using the CAPM formula.

## Key Results & Interpretation

- **Beta ≈ 1.21**  
  This indicates that Apple is approximately **21% more volatile than the market**.
  Empirically, this confirms that large-cap technology stocks behave as **aggressive assets**.

- **R-Squared ≈ 0.64**  
  About **64% of Apple’s return variation is explained by overall market movements**.

- **Unexplained Variation ≈ 36%**  
  A significant portion of returns is not captured by CAPM, highlighting the model’s
  limitations and motivating the use of **multi-factor asset pricing models**.

**Research Question:**  
*What explains the missing 36% of returns?*

**Natural Extension:**  
This leads directly to **Fama–French factor models**, which incorporate additional sources
of systematic risk beyond the market.
